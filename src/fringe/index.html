				<h2>Events in Lisbon</h2>

				<p>June in Lisbon is basically one big party. The City celebrates its patron saint (Stº António), which for you means the smell of sardines and little parties in small streets throughout the city. <a href="http://www.festasdelisboa.com/2014/">This website lists all of them</a>. Highlights:</p>
				<ul class="boxy-list">
