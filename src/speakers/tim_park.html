			<p>Tim works in Microsoft's strategic engagements team at Microsoft, where we works on solving some of the hardest engineering problems for partners and customers, with a particular focus on the Internet of Things. Previous to Microsoft, Tim worked at Nest Labs, which worked on reinventing the humble thermostat for the internet era, and in the Android team at Google. Tim is also the maintainer of the Nitrogen project, which enables makers to easily build secure interconnected devices and applications. When not in front of a computer, Tim is probably atop a mountain bike or surf board in Santa Cruz, California.</p>
