			<p>Martin writes, runs and sometimes breaks software by day, by night he is also a member of ruby-core, one of the maintainers of the Ruby OpenSSL extension and the author of krypt. Cryptography is his passion, and not only after the epiphany he had once realizing that his last name carries "ssl" in it. He loves programming languages and dreams of finding the perfect approach to write web apps one day.</p>
