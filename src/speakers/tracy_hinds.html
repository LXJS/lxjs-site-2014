			<p>Prior work in addictions and healthcare administration short-circuited Tracy's brain and her ability to make sound decisions, so she quit her job and insanely chose to focus on programming and the anthropological study of the Hacker. When she isn't monkeying up rocks/trees or bicycling to and from the glorious amount of tech meetups she organizes and enjoys in Portland, she's talking your ear off about them(or anything else she's read about that day). You have been warned.</p>
