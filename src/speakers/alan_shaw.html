			<p>A nodejs web developer attempting to discover the limits of the possible by venturing a little way past them into the impossible. Alan builds and styles for the web every day and has worked with JavaScript for as long as he can remember.</p>
			<p>A lover of functional programming, Node slowly became a big part of all the projects Alan works on. Now Alan is all like "node all the things" all the time.</p>
			<p>In his spare time Alan hacks on npm modules, browserify transforms and grunt plugins. He builds and maintains <a href="https://david-dm.org/" target="_blank">david-dm.org</a>, co-organises the Nodebots London and Meteor London meetup, pilots nano copters into walls and hacks on hardware.</p>
